Just a simple OOP project, or is it?


This was created so I could revise my Object Oriented Programming skills and apply them as I learned C#.
Primary goal was to assess my skills and scale them according to a (undisclosed) course I was taking.
Secondary goals were to get familiar and get experienced with WinForms based plugins/tools like DevExpress that have new addon tools & U.I. design.
